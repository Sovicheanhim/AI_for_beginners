These are simple AI programs that's beginner-friendly and built using only Python.
The main code is very short, thanks to all the developers that have contributed over the years, building all the modules.

If you run these programs, and it shows an error that says can't find the module. 
Go to cmd and type this command: </br><code>pip install your_required_module</code>

For example, if I can't find the <code>apiai</code> module, then I need to go to cmd and type the command:
<code>pip install apiai</code>

</br>After installing the module, I think everything should work fine for you have fun with coding!
